# Ambitious Direction 2: Collaborative Intelligence Network + Decision Rooms

## Vision
Evolve Fluxnote into a collaborative intelligence network where teams build shared “decision rooms” that capture evidence, debate, and consensus—then serialize those decisions into reusable playbooks.

## Why this direction
The current system already supports chat, summaries, tags, and idea storage. This direction layers in collaboration, governance, and decision‑quality tooling to become a team intelligence platform rather than a personal note system.

## 5–7 Step Arc (far‑flung)
1) **Multi‑User Security + Org Spaces**
   - Real auth, orgs, and projects with scoped access to notes and summaries.
2) **Shared Idea Commons**
   - Teams contribute ideas and evidence to shared spaces.  
   - Ownership, provenance, and revision history become first‑class fields.
3) **Decision Rooms**
   - A decision room is a structured workspace that ties: problem statement, evidence set, assumptions, pros/cons, and outcome.  
   - Rooms are fed by automatic retrieval from the knowledge base.
4) **Argument Mapping + Debate Graphs**
   - Visual map of positions, supporting claims, and counter‑claims.  
   - Each claim links back to specific sources and timestamps.
5) **Consensus + Divergence Engine**
   - LLM‑assisted summarizer that extracts consensus and highlights irreconcilable disagreements.  
   - Teams can “lock” a decision once consensus thresholds are met.
6) **Reusable Playbooks**
   - Decisions produce structured playbooks: key signals, triggers, fallback plans.  
   - Playbooks auto‑update when evidence shifts or new data arrives.
7) **Cross‑Team Intelligence Exchange**
   - Share anonymized decision artifacts across teams or orgs.  
   - Benchmark decision quality and discover best practices via a meta‑layer.

## Enablers / Foundational Work
- Auth + per‑user session isolation
- Command history sync and reliable context chat
- Tagging + vector search for shared retrieval
- Audit trails and versioned summaries

## Risks / Hard Problems
- Governance: who can edit, lock, and override decisions
- UX complexity of argument maps for non‑experts
- Data privacy and access control for shared notes

## Why it’s compelling
It transforms Fluxnote into a decision‑quality engine for teams: not just storing notes, but turning evidence into structured, reusable decisions that stay current.
