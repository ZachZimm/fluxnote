The culture of Thailand is a unique blend of various influences that have evolved over time. Local customs, animist beliefs, Buddhist traditions, and regional ethnic and cultural practices have all played a significant role in shaping Thai culture. "Thainess," a term that refers to the distinctive qualities that define the national identity of Thailand, is evident in the country's history, customs, and traditions. Buddhism remains the dominant religion in Thailand with more than 40,000 temples, but Islam, Christianity, and other faiths are also practiced.

Thailand's historical and cultural heritage has been shaped by interactions with neighboring cultures as well as far-reaching cultures such as Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and Persian. The ancient city of Ayutthaya served as a global trade center, and early European visitors recognized Ayutthaya as one of the great powers of Asia, alongside China and India. In modern times, Thailand's cultural landscape has been shaped by the influence of global trends. This includes the adoption of modern educational practices and the promotion of science and technology while also preserving traditional customs and practices.

Thailand's cultural influence extends beyond its borders, shaping neighboring countries' television programming, dance, films, art, fashion, music, and cuisine. The country's 5F cultural policy, which promotes food, films, fashion, fighting, and festivals, aims to become an important cultural export to drive economic development and generate income for the country. Thai cuisine has become an integral part of restaurant menus worldwide, while Muay Thai, a traditional Thai martial art, has gained global popularity as a combat sport. Traditional festivals such as Songkran and Loy Krathong have also attracted tourists from around the world.

Thai visual arts have a long and varied history. Ceramic production in Thailand has been traced back to prehistoric times. Ban Chiang archaeological site in northeast Thailand is one of the most important prehistoric settlements in Southeast Asia and a World Heritage Site since 1992. The Sukhothai Kingdom, which emerged in the mid-1200s, marked another significant period for ceramic production in Thailand. During the Ayutthaya period and beyond, Thai ceramic continued to develop and evolve, with Benjarong porcelain becoming especially prominent.

Traditional Thai paintings often depict scenes from Buddhist mythology, literature, history, or daily life, blending realism and symbolism. These paintings are mostly found in temples and palaces, where they serve as decorations and illustrations of religious texts. In the 19th century, Thai artists began experimenting with modernism and abstraction, incorporating Western techniques into their work. Contemporary Thai painting continues to build upon this experimentation, resulting in a diverse range of approaches and aesthetics.

Traditional Thai houses are usually constructed of natural materials such as bamboo or wood and elevated on stilts to protect against floods and pests. Buddhist temples in Thailand, known as "wats," have an enclosing wall that divides them from the secular world. Wat architecture has seen many changes in Thailand over the course of history, but all adhere to the same principles.

Thai literature reflects the history, culture, religion, and worldview of the Thai people, as well as their interactions with other nations and peoples. One of the earliest forms of Thai literature is the stone inscription, which records historical events, royal decrees, religious teachings, and cultural values. During the Ayutthaya period, various literary forms were developed, and many classical works were revived and adapted during the Rattanakosin period.

Thai classical dance has several main types, including Rabam, Ram, Fon/Sueng/Manora, Khon, and Lakhon. Within these categories, there are subtypes. Thai classical dance has had a profound influence on neighboring countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, and Laos. It is widely regarded as a highly refined and sophisticated art form, with intricate movements, ornate costumes, and complex choreography.

The music of Thailand can be categorized into two main genres: classical and popular. Thai classical music is the most revered form of Thai music and is considered the pinnacle of the country's unique musical heritage. Thai popular music, also known as Phleng Thai sakon, includes traditional country music and modern music genres that have gained popularity in recent years.

Traditional Thai theatre includes various forms such as Khon (masked dance-drama), Nang (shadow play), Lakhon (classical dance-drama), Likay (folk theatre), Manora (classical dance-drama), and Hun (puppetry). Each of these forms has its own unique style, costume, and music.

Thailand has a thriving film industry, with a rich history dating back to the late 19th century. Thai cinema has produced a wide range of genres and styles, including horror films, documentaries, dramas, romance, comedies, and action movies. Major cinema chains in Thailand include Major Cineplex and SF Cinema City.

Thai cuisine is known for its diverse range of dishes, which include spicy salads, soups, curries, stir-fries, and desserts. The flavors in Thai cuisine are balanced and often incorporate sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy elements. Thai cuisine varies across regions, with dishes influenced by local traditions and ingredient availability.

Thailand allows freedom of religion unless it threatens the security of the state. The country is predominantly Buddhist, with a strong influence from traditional beliefs regarding ancestral and natural spirits. Prior to the rise of Theravada Buddhism, both Indian Brahminical religion and Mahayana Buddhism were present in Thailand.

Thai Buddhist marriage ceremonies are generally divided into two parts: a Buddhist component and a non-Buddhist component rooted in folk traditions. The Thai bride price system, known as "sin sot," is an essential part of the marriage and involves the groom paying a sum of money to the bride's family.

Traditional Thai funerals last for at least one week and focus on making merit for the deceased. Activities include distributing Buddhist scriptures, giving gifts to temples, and inviting monks to chant prayers for the deceased's protection. The corpse is cremated, and the urn is kept in a chedi in the local temple.

Thai etiquette values refinement and avoiding coarseness. The "wai" is a prayer-like gesture used in greetings, leave-taking, acknowledgements, or apologies, varying depending on the relative status. Thais tend to use the ubiquitous phrase "mai pen rai" (meaning "it doesn't matter") to minimize disagreements, mistakes, or misfortunes and avoid conflict.

Thai customs regarding monks prohibit physical contact between them and women, leading to various methods being employed to avoid accidental contact. Thai dining etiquette has also been influenced by the introduction of the fork and spoon during the reign of King Rama IV and King Rama V. These utensils have become the norm for dining in Thailand.

Important holidays in Thai culture include Songkran, the traditional Thai New Year festival, and Loy Krathong, a festival celebrated on the full moon of the 12th lunar month. National Elephant Day celebrates the cultural and historical significance of the elephant in Thailand. Thailand has several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and intangible cultural heritage elements recognized by UNESCO.

Thai culture is a rich tapestry of traditions, beliefs, and practices that have been influenced by various cultures over the centuries. Despite modernization and globalization, Thailand continues to preserve and promote its unique cultural heritage, making it a fascinating and vibrant country.
