Marcus Licinius Crassus (115 â€“ 53 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who played a key role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. He is often called "the richest man in Rome."

Crassus began his public career as a military commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during his civil war. Following Sulla's dictatorship, Crassus amassed an enormous fortune through property speculation. He rose to political prominence following his victory over the slave revolt led by Spartacus, sharing the consulship with his rival Pompey the Great.

A political and financial patron of Julius Caesar, Crassus joined Caesar and Pompey in the unofficial political alliance known as the First Triumvirate. Together, they dominated the Roman political system. While Caesar and Crassus were lifelong allies, Crassus and Pompey disliked each other. The alliance was restabilized at the Luca Conference in 56 BC, after which Crassus and Pompey again served jointly as consuls. Following his second consulship, Crassus was appointed governor of Roman Syria. Crassus used Syria as the launchpad for a military campaign against the Parthian Empire, ending in his defeat at the Battle of Carrhae and death.

Crassus' death permanently unraveled the alliance between Caesar and Pompey, leading to Caesar's civil war against Pompey and the optimates.

Family and Background:
Marcus Licinius Crassus was a member of the gens Licinia, a plebeian family in Rome. He was the second of three sons born to the eminent senator Publius Licinius Crassus. Crassus married his brother's widow, Tertulla. Crassus' grandfather, Marcus Licinius Crassus, was given the Greek nickname Agelastus. Crassus was raised in modest circumstances and acquired his wealth rather than inherited it.

Youth and the First Civil War:
After the Marian purges and the death of Gaius Marius, Lucius Cornelius Cinna imposed proscriptions on Sulla's supporters. Crassus fled to Hispania, where he recruited 2,500 men and used his army to extort money from local cities. After Cinna's death, Crassus joined Sulla in Greece. During Sulla's civil war, Crassus commanded the right flank of Sulla's army at the Battle of the Colline Gate, ensuring Sulla's victory and making Sulla the master of Rome.

Rise to Power and Wealth:
Crassus rebuilt his family's fortunes, which had been confiscated during the Marian-Cinnan proscriptions. He amassed wealth through property speculation, slave trafficking, and real estate purchases. Crassus created Rome's first fire brigade, which he used to acquire properties at low prices. Despite his wealth, Crassus avoided excess and luxury at home.

Crassus and Spartacus:
Crassus was elected praetor in 73 BC and took command against Spartacus during the Third Servile War. He revived the practice of decimation to strengthen his army's morale. Crassus built a ditch and rampart across the Bruttium peninsula to trap Spartacus, who managed to break out. Crassus defeated Spartacus in the Battle of the Silarius River, capturing and crucifying 6,000 slaves along the Via Appia.

First Triumvirate-Alliance with Pompey and Caesar:
In 65 BC, Crassus was elected censor. He financed Caesar's election as pontifex maximus and supported his military campaigns. Caesar mediated between Crassus and Pompey, leading to the formation of the First Triumvirate in 60 BC. Crassus and Pompey served as consuls in 55 BC, with Crassus leaving for Syria.

Syrian Governorship and Death:
Crassus received Syria as his province and sought military glory by attacking Parthia. He refused aid from Artavasdes II of Armenia and was led into a trap by the Parthians. In 53 BC, Crassus' legions were defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. Crassus was killed during a peace negotiation with the Parthian general Surena, and a story emerged that molten gold was poured into his mouth as a mockery of his wealth.

Artistic Representations:
Crassus has been depicted in literature, ballet, film, television, music, and video games. He is a character in Howard Fast's novel "Spartacus," and portrayed by Laurence Olivier in the 1960 film adaptation. Crassus also appears in television series such as "Spartacus: War of the Damned" and "Horrible Histories," and in video games like "Sid Meier's Civilization V" and "Praetorians."
